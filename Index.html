    <h1>STOP Child Abuse ( Help Us break the silence).</h1>
<p> Child abuse must end. I don't like that children have to suffer through difficult situations because of their parentsor any human being. There are many different types of abuse, but in my project I am going to focus on physical and sexual abuse. They voices are not litsened to so, lets be their voice.</p>

    <p> Pete story is his mom has a bad temper. She would throw books down the stair case at his dad. His dad left when he was around 5 or 6 and all that temper turned on him. His mom my mum kicked, beated him , throttled him, threw him down the stairs and pushed him  into a scalding hot bath. She once held his  head under water and another time she shoved a full bar of soap in his mouth. Even though, she had these agrresions she was loving to. But, it was confused of as when she will have these agressions. Sometimes his mom will apologize but, other times he would be the blame. He didnt misbehave as a kid. But, the relationshi[p that the mom had with his sister was more better. Yes, she will get hit but, it was a bad as Petes.</p>
